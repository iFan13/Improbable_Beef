# Improbable Beef

## What is Improbable Beef?

Improbable Beef is a food startup company. They have partnered with Roza, a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Their goal is to discover and document bacterial species with particular interest in baceterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Roza hypothesizes that the human navel may be able to play host to this desired bacteria. To test her hypothesis roza has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize the human navel.

## Repository Overview

This repository serves as the back end hosting for the deployed dashboard [https://ifan13.github.io/Improbable_Beef/](https://ifan13.github.io/Improbable_Beef/). The project is to help fellow researchers, Roza & her volunteers access an individual person's bacterial biodiversity based on an ID system. Participants will know their own IDs however non participants would not allowing for anonymity. Should a desireable candidate to manufacture synthetic beef be identified, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel and potentially sell their bacteria to Improbable Beef.
